		"HTML5/CSS3": "In my first 2-3 months of learning frontend, I learned HTML5 semantics, metatags, building website skeletons out of HTML elements. What goes behind HTML, I learned CSS3, topics like responsive web design, specificity in CSS, flexbox, grid, pseudoclasses, pseudoelements, etc.",
		"SASS/SCSS": "The next step in my learning journey was SCSS. I learned how to work with this pre-processor, how to work with SCSS variables, mixins, @use & @forward. How and why we could work with the Block Element Modifier methodology and make web design much easier.",
		"JavaScript": "The next step was JavaScript. I started by understanding the basics of JavaScript such as variables, data types, operators, connecting to the API and control structures. I also learned ES6+ features such as const, let, arrow functions, template literals, array and object destructuring, import, export, etc.",
		"React.js": "The next milestone in my learning journey was React.js. I delved into the fascinating world of React.js. At its core, I learned that React revolves around components. I learned about features such as props, rendering lists, conditional content, CSS modules, state handling, component lifecycle, connecting to a database, managing app-wide state with context, Redux, React Router, working with controlled and uncontrolled forms, and animating React components with framer motion or React Transition Group.",
		"Next.js": "What comes after React.js is its framework - Next.js. At this stage, I started exploring the beauty of this technology, such as file-based routing, page pre-rendering. Data fetching with SSR, SSG (with ISR). Also explored such great features as API routes, and working with HTTP requests inside them, and connecting to the database.",
		"MERN": "Being ambitious, I started thinking about building full stack applications, so I started learning the MERN Stack. I love how MERN provides excellent performance and scalability. With my frontend knowledge of React, MongoDB, and some Node.js, I wanted to dig deeper into MERN and connect frontend with backend and build beautiful full-stack web applications.",
		"Node.js": "Node.js is the next step in my learning journey. I want to explore the backend, be a more conscious developer, and understand the inner workings of web applications from a closer look.",
